## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring the C programming language through practical examples and projects. The projects range from simple programs, such as "Hello World" and basic arithmetic operations, to more complex tasks like file I/O, data structures, and algorithm implementations. Each program is well-documented with comments and explanations to help you understand the underlying concepts.

## Features

- **Basic Programs:** Simple programs covering control structures, loops, conditionals, and basic input/output.
- **Intermediate Projects:** Examples that delve into functions, arrays, pointers, and structures.
- **Advanced Topics:** Complex projects that include dynamic memory allocation, data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Each program includes detailed comments and a multi-line header explaining its purpose, usage, and logic.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The programs are written in standard C, ensuring they compile and run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## Installation

To run the programs in this repository, you need a C compiler installed on your system. Here are some common options:

- **GCC:**  
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`  
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc`  
- **Clang:** Available on most platforms as an alternative to GCC.
- **Windows:** Use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for C development.
