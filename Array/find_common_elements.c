    Program: Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays
    Author: Arindam Ghosh

    Description:
    This program finds and prints the common elements between two arrays of integers.
    The user provides the sizes and elements of the two arrays. The program compares each
    element of the first array with every element of the second array to find matches.
    It ensures that duplicates in the common output are avoided by marking already matched elements.

    Process:
      - Read sizes and elements of two arrays from the user.
      - Compare elements of the first array with the second using nested loops.
      - If a common element is found and hasnâ€™t been printed before, display it.
      - Optional: Use a temporary array or flag mechanism to prevent duplicate outputs.

    Example:
      Input:
        arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
      Output:
        Common elements: 3 4

    This program demonstrates nested iteration, comparison logic, and basic duplicate handling in C.
